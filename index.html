		<p>With our project being close to a game that is very popular, we had fun getting as far as we could with the game.We worked on trying to get it to be simple and not so complex like the real game. You are basically a dot that is trying to get across a street with heavy traffic and a killer river.</p>
		<h3>Reflections</h3>
		<p>With this project I helped with the website and i helped with some codeing to make the enemies(cars) move from right to left.</p>
